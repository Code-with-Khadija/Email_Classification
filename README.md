# Email Classification

## Overview
This project implements an email classification system using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails by leveraging text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes email text.
- **Feature Extraction:** Uses techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training:** Implements multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Analyzes model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization:** Includes graphs and charts for better understanding of results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NLTK (for NLP processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd email-classification
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load and run `Email_classification.ipynb`
3. Follow the steps to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled emails categorized as spam or non-spam. You can use publicly available datasets like the [Enron Spam Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
